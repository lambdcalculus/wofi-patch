.SH NAME
wofi \- configuration file and styling

.SH DESCRIPTION
Wofi's configuration format is very simple, consisting of key value pairs in snake case. The majority of the config options are the command line options, there are however a small handful of options only accessible via wofi's config.

Mode specific options for the built\-in modes are documented in \fBwofi\fR(7). They are placed in the config file in the format \fBmode\-example_opt=val\fR. For example dmenu has an option called \fBparse_action\fR which would be placed in the config as \fBdmenu\-parse_action=true\fR.

Anything following a # is considered to be a comment unless the # is prefixed with a \\. For this reason in order to put a backslash in the config it must be escaped as well giving \\\\.

.SH CONFIG OPTIONS
Most of the options here are the command flags as found in \fBwofi\fR(1) in snake case, however some are unique to the config.

.TP
.B style=\fIPATH\fR
Specifies the CSS file to use as the stylesheet.
.TP
.B stylesheet=\fIPATH\fR
Specifies the CSS file to use as the stylesheet. This option is NOT the same as \fBstyle\fR. Absolute paths are absolute however relative paths are relative to the wofi config folder location $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wofi and NOT the current working directory as they are with \fBstyle\fR. They are also NOT relative to the path as specified by \fB\-\-conf\fR. This option comes from rootbar and is probably more confusing than it's worth. You should probably use \fBstyle\fR unless you're sure this is what you want.
.TP
.B color=\fIPATH\fR
Specifies the colors file to use.
.TP

.SH CSS SELECTORS
Any GTK widget can be selected by using the name of its CSS node, these however might change with updates and are not guaranteed to stay constant. Wofi also provides certain widgets with names and classes which can be referenced from CSS to give access to the most important widgets easily. \fBwofi\fR(7) contains the current widget layout used by wofi so if you want to get into CSS directly using GTK widget names look there for info.

.SH COLORS
The colors file should be formatted as new line separated hex values. These values should be in the standard HTML format and begin with a hash. These colors will be loaded however wofi doesn't know what color should be used for what so you must reference them from your CSS.

You can reference these from your CSS by doing \-\-wofi\-color<n> where <n> is the line number \- 1. For example to reference the color on line 1 you would do \fB\-\-wofi\-color0\fR.

The colors can also be referenced by doing \-\-wofi\-rgb\-color<n> where <n> is the line number \- 1. The difference between these is the format used to replace the macro.

\-\-wofi\-color<n> is replaced with an HTML color code in the format #FFFFFF. \-\-wofi\-rgb\-color<n> is replaced with comma separated rgb values in the format 255, 255, 255. The correct usage of \-\-wofi\-rgb\-color<n> is to wrap it in rgb() or rgba(). Note that it does not return an alpha value so combining it with rgba() should be done like so \fBrgba(\-\-wofi\-rgb\-color0, 0.8)\fR. This would set the color to line 1 with an opacity of 80%.
